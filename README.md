The **ALX Listing App** is the foundational scaffold for building an Airbnb clone. This project focuses on creating a modern, maintainable, and scalable codebase using cutting-edge tools like **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **ESLint**. The goal is to lay a solid groundwork for a dynamic and responsive property listing page.

The app runs without errors on http://localhost:3000

Tailwind styles apply correctly

The folder structure and file organization are clean and modular

🧪 Next Steps
Start building reusable components like Card and Button in components/common/, and define their prop types in interfaces/index.ts.

Happy building! 🛠️
